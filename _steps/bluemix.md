All the [Watson Developer Cloud services](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/services-catalog.html)
are managed and billed via Bluemix so if you don't already have an account,
you'll need to [sign up for a free 30 day Bluemix trial](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/?target=/catalog/%3fcategory=watson).

Bluemix is IBM's cloud offering, which you can also use to bring your cognitive
applications to life. If you're new to Bluemix or Watson, the Watson Developer
Cloud [Getting Started](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/getting_started/)
documentation is a good place to begin.

Don't worry if you don't want to use Bluemix though; once you've created a
Conversation service you can call it from anywhere.
