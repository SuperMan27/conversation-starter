Before diving in and getting started with the Conversation service, it's
worth taking a bit of time thinking about what you are trying to achieve.
Watson Conversation can be used instead of the Natural Language Classifier
service for a variety of purposes but the chances are you're thinking about
creating a chatbot.

For some clues to why chatbots are popular, and a few likely uses, take a look
at Simon Burns' [Seriously, what do I need a bot for?](https://medium.com/@snrubnomis/seriously-what-do-i-need-a-bot-for-8b91a5ffac1a)
article. I'm also on the look out for other examples of what's possible,
for example [Sayfe Space from the Disrupt London 2016 Hackathon](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/04/disrupt-london-2016-hackathon-winners/)
so please get in touch if you know of any!

[3 steps for building a cognitive solution in 70 days](https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2016/cognitive-solution-70-days-joe-kozhaya/)
is also worth a read to get an idea of the full process, and the work required
to prepare your data and train the system.

Even when you've decided that a chatbot is the way to go, it's still worth
considering whether it should chat or not!
