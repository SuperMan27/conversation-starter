I originally posted [a few useful Watson Conversation articles and videos on my blog](https://jtlog.wordpress.com/2016/09/01/a-little-more-conversation/),
but they weren't at all organised, and there are new articles all the time.

To make it easier to get started with the Conversation service, and hopefully
to keep up with new articles and changes to the service, I'm planning to
create a quick start guide.

Please open an issue on GitHub if you spot any problems, or know of any
resources that it would be worth including!
